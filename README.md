📊 R Mini Project: Global CO2 Emissions and GDP Per Capita Analysis

Project Overview

This project fulfills the requirement for the Statistics using R Lab course. It performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global time-series data related to economic growth and environmental impact (CO2 emissions).

The analysis utilizes core R packages (dplyr, ggplot2, readxl, tidyr) to visualize distributions, explore relationships, and quantify the strong positive correlation between GDP Per Capita and CO2 Emissions Per Capita.

Repository Contents

R mini project.R: The complete R script containing all data loading, cleaning, visualization (ggplot2), and statistical modeling (lm and cor).

PROJECT_REPORT.md: The final, detailed project report containing all figures, statistical output, and interpretation for submission.

/assets: Folder containing the three generated figures (Figure 1.png, Figure 2.png, Figure 3.png).

World_GDP_Population_CO2_Emissions_Dataset.xlsx: The raw data file used for the analysis.

How to Run the Analysis

Clone this repository.

Open R mini project.R in RStudio.

Ensure the necessary packages (dplyr, ggplot2, readxl, tidyr) are installed.

Update the file path on line 24 of the R script to point to the correct location of the .xlsx file on your local machine.

Run the script to reproduce all figures and the statistical output.
